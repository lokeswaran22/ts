# ✅ Removed Bottom Buttons from Employee Options Modal

## What Was Changed:

### Removed from `index.html`:
- ❌ "Mark Leave" button
- ❌ "Mark Permission" button  
- ❌ "Cancel" button

These buttons were located at the bottom of the Employee Options modal and have been removed.

## Current Status:

✅ **Employee Options modal cleaned up**
✅ **Buttons removed from bottom**
✅ **Modal is now simpler**

## How It Works Now:

### Employee Options Modal:
- Shows "Select an action:" text
- No longer has the bottom action buttons
- Cleaner, simpler interface

### To Add Leave/Permission:
The functionality for marking leave and permission will need to be integrated directly into the employee row actions or accessed through a different method.

## Next Steps (If Needed):

If you want to add Leave/Permission functionality back, we can:

1. **Add buttons to employee row** - Direct "Leave" and "Permission" buttons next to each employee name
2. **Add to header actions** - Global buttons for marking leave/permission
3. **Add to context menu** - Right-click on employee name to show options

Let me know which approach you prefer, and I'll implement it!
